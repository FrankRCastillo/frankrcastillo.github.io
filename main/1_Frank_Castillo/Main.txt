Hello and welcome,

I am a first-year PhD student of Modeling and Simulation at the University of Central Florida.

Professionally and academically, I'm interested in the use of computational techniques to solve problems in anti-money laundering programs within banking.

I'm also very passionate about current affairs, economics, politics, and the use of science to promote the common defense and general welfare.

In 2013, I earned an honorable discharge after nine years of service in the United States Marine Corps.
