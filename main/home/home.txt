Hello and welcome,

I am a first-year PhD student of Modeling and Simulation at the University of Central Florida.  Professionally and academically, I'm interested in the use of computational methods to improve anti-money laundering programs for financial institutions.  I'm also very passionate about current affairs, economics, politics, and the use of facts, science, and reason to help "establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity."  In 2013, I earned an honorable discharge after nine years of service in the United States Marine Corps.
