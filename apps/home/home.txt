Hello,

I work with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) technologies in both professional and academic capacities. My goal is to produce work that helps advance the field of AML towards a more secure financial system. Prior to my time in the private sector, I served in the United States Marine Corps between 2004 and 2013.

Feel free to reach out and connect!

Thanks,
Frank
