Hello and welcome,

In this website, I hope to explore and develop my interests in financial and regulatory technologies, as well as current affairs, economics, and politics. In addition to these interests, I'm also very passionate about the use of facts, science, and reason to help "establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity."

Professionally, I work in the field of Anti-Money Laundering (AML). Academically, I'm a recent graduate of the Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Systems program at the University of South Florida; I recently applied to the PhD in Modeling and Simulation program at the University of Central Florida and am currently awaiting a decision! My hope is to combine my professional and academic interests to help advance the field of AML towards a more secure financial system.

Lastly, I'm a veteran of the US Marine Corps, where I served from 2004 to 2013.
