Hello and welcome,

I'm a recent graduate of the Master of Science in Business Analytics and Information Systems program at the University of South Florida; I recently applied to the PhD in Modeling and Simulation program at the University of Central Florida and am currently awaiting a decision!

Professionally and academically, I'm interested in the use of computational techniques to solve problems in anti-money laundering programs within financial institutions. I'm also very passionate about current affairs, economics, politics, and the use of facts, science, and reason to help "establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity." In 2013, I earned an honorable discharge after nine years of service in the United States Marine Corps.
