<h2>
  Welcome
</h2>

<p>
  I'm a researcher and educator focused on modeling and simulation, anti-money laundering systems, and macroeconomic agent-based models. I teach at St. Petersburg College and am currently completing my PhD in Modeling and Simulation at the University of Central Florida under Prof. Vishnu Prabhu.

<p>
  Prior to my time in academia, I worked for serveral financial institutions and other organizations, primarily in fintech and compliance. Prior to that, I served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2004 to 2013.
